# Client production onboarding

The end-to-end journey a new client follows from a fresh production deployment
to scheduling their first game, and how each step is verified. This ties
together the pieces built under #174; deployment mechanics (env vars, backup
commands, migration checks) live in the [production runbook](production-runbook.md),
which this guide references rather than repeats.

## The journey

```text
Fresh production deployment (durable DB, no demo data)
  → client claims the installation with a one-time setup code
  → client creates their own first League Admin and signs in
  → guided Initial Setup walks the hierarchy: owner → program → venues/rinks
    → season/league/divisions → clubs/teams → players/officials → game ice → staff
  → each step is entered manually or bulk-imported from templates
  → onboarding status reports what still blocks scheduling
  → back up / restore is proven to reproduce the configured client
  → begin scheduling
```

Every write goes through the normal service → store → audit path; nothing about
setup progress lives in the browser. Restart, redeploy, or a fresh sign-in all
resume from the same server-derived state.

## 1. Durable production deployment

Production must run on a durable SQL store and never seed demo data. Set
`APP_MODE=production` and a real `DATABASE_URL` (durable Postgres, or a real
SQLite file for a single-instance pilot). `/api/readiness` fails closed for
in-memory or ephemeral storage, stale migrations, missing admin, or unhardened
cookies — treat it as the go/no-go gate before routing traffic. See the runbook
sections *Environment*, *Migration verification*, and *Durable-store readiness*.

## 2. One-time client-owned admin claim

The client creates their own first League Admin in the browser at `/setup`, so
the deployment operator never chooses, sees, or stores the client's password.
The operator generates a high-entropy `INITIAL_SETUP_CODE`, delivers it through
a secure channel, and the client exchanges it (plus a username/password of their
choosing) for exactly one atomically-created League Admin.

- `GET /api/bootstrap/status` → `claim_available` reflects a fresh, durable,
  unclaimed installation with a configured code — and nothing else (no account
  count, username, or database detail).
- `POST /api/bootstrap/claim` validates the code in constant time, creates the
  admin, marks the installation claimed, and audits the claim. A second attempt
  fails closed with `409 already_claimed`; two admins can never exist.

Remove `INITIAL_SETUP_CODE` after a successful claim. Full mechanics: runbook
*One-time client-owned admin claim*.

## 3. Guided Initial Setup

A first admin signing in to an empty database is routed to a resumable **Initial
Setup** wizard that sequences the whole hierarchy. It does not trap the admin —
they can navigate to any advanced screen — and it never stores progress in the
browser; every step reads back from persisted data. Each step reuses the
existing Setup drawers, the Users screen, the Import screen, and the Calendar.

## 4. Manual entry and bulk import converge on one model

Both paths write the same domain entities through the same services — the wizard
creates no parallel data store. Small configurations can be typed in; a full
client hierarchy is imported from nine CSV sheets on the Import screen:
`organizations`, `programs`, `venues_rinks`, `competition` (season/league/
optional division), `clubs`, `permanent_teams`, `players`, `registrations`, and
`season_venue_access` (issue #260's locked design). Imports are matched by
stable external codes (never names — a Club's `club_code` closed the last gap),
validate every cross-file reference before any write (every error in one pass,
never fail-fast), commit each batch in one transaction, are idempotent on
repeat upload, and never delete rows that are absent from a later file. A
`permanent_teams` row carries a required `league_code`: a Team is a permanent
member of a League (which belongs to its Program), validated to sit in the
Team's Program (#283 Slice E). A `registrations` row's `league_code` is always
explicit and validated against the season's chain — never derived from a
division or "the season's only league" — and must equal the Team's own
permanent League (a Team may only register into its own League).
Every commit reports created/updated/skipped counts per entity and writes a
batch audit plus entity audits attributed to the signed-in admin.

The Import screen's "Setup profile" — seven quick questions (what you're
setting up, whether you use clubs/divisions, importing players now, one venue
or several, granting venue access now, first-time vs. updating) — is pure
UI-routing state: it only decides which of the nine sheet cards are shown and
which contextual hints appear, has no backend field of its own, and is never
persisted. Every answer combination still submits through this one canonical
import engine.

## 5. Onboarding status: what still blocks scheduling

`GET /api/v2/onboarding/status` (League-Admin only, canonical vocabulary —
same shape as the legacy `GET /api/onboarding/status`) derives progress from
persisted records and the owner/program/venue rules — never a browser step
counter. It returns ordered `steps`, a flat `blocking` list (each individually
actionable — missing organization, program, owner tie, venue, rink, game ice,
season, league, division, team, or a dangling parent), and non-blocking
`warnings` (no players or officials yet, orphaned records). `ready_to_schedule`
is true when nothing blocks; `complete` additionally requires the warnings
clear. The wizard's **Start scheduling** action unlocks only when
`ready_to_schedule` is true.

## 6. Recovery: backup and restore

A configured client must be reproducible from a backup. The runbook documents
the `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` (Postgres) and file-copy (SQLite) mechanics; the
checked-in acceptance smoke proves the round trip actually works:

```bash
python -m hockey_scheduler.acceptance.backup_restore --database-url ./client.db
```

It backs the deployment up, restores into a fresh empty database, starts the app
against the restore, and verifies the record census and onboarding status match
the source — exiting non-zero on any divergence. Run it after configuring a
client and after any risky operation. See runbook *Backup/restore acceptance
check*.

## 7. Home/Tasks hub setup-progress (#204/#330)

A second, narrower progress view sits alongside the wizard above:
`GET /api/v2/setup/progress` (`MANAGE_ARENA` — League Admin **and** Arena
Manager, unlike this wizard's League-Admin-only `onboarding/status`) resolves
the caller's ACTIVE Program **and Season** from the #159 session context and
reports completion for the six Setup workflows #204 names — league profile
and seasons, permanent teams, season participation/divisions, clubs/players/
staff, venues/rinks/ice, and imports/onboarding — scoped to that one Program,
never the whole installation. League profile/seasons and permanent teams are
deliberately Program-wide (an integrity check with no Season dimension of
its own, for teams); season participation and facilities are scoped further,
to the ACTUAL resolved Season, so an older Season's registrations or granted
ice can never mask required work in a newly-selected Season.

The Dashboard's Home/Tasks hub card leads with a single "Continue setup"
primary action naming the actual next incomplete workflow and deep-linking
straight into that workflow's real entry point — a create drawer, the Ice
Availability Builder, or the Setup hierarchy tree, never a generic Setup
landing; the other five list below as a non-competing secondary list
(today's `.act.primary` convention — see #204's "one primary action per
screen" principle), each with an accessible, visible-text status ("Done" /
"To do" / "Optional" — never an icon-only badge).

`next` is filtered to workflows the caller's role can actually execute (an
Arena Manager, who holds `MANAGE_ARENA` but not `MANAGE_SETUP`, is routed to
facilities, never to a League-Admin-only action like "Add Season") AND that
are actually safe to run given the resolved Season's own state (#331 review
round 3): "facilities" needs a resolved, ACTIVE Season to generate ice into
(its real write, `commit_ice_availability`, itself requires an active
Season — #159), and "participation" needs that same Season to be active,
not archived, for the identical reason. A workflow that is permitted but
blocked on the Season is never handed out as `next` — a CTA the operator
cannot actually complete — the response's `next_blocked` names it instead,
with a reason code and a plain-language explanation of what to resolve
first, so a role that cannot resolve it themselves (an Arena Manager
blocked on a Season only a League Admin can create) is still told clearly
rather than routed into a silent failure.

The `workflows` list itself is also filtered to what the caller's role can
manage, not global (a reversal of the original design — an Arena Manager
must never receive League-Admin-only completion signals or exact team/
registration/player counts, the same role/privacy boundary `next`'s own
filter exists to hold). `complete` is still computed from the full,
unfiltered internal list first, so it keeps meaning "the WHOLE Program's
setup is done," never flipping true just because the one workflow a caller
can see happens to be done. The complete-state secondary "Import data"
action inherits this: it renders only when "import" survives that same
per-role filter, so an Arena Manager (MANAGE_SETUP-only workflow) never
receives an enabled action for a surface they cannot use.

Once every required workflow reads done the card shows the required success
state ("All setup steps complete" plus a Schedule link) instead of
disappearing; a failed fetch shows a per-card error with a working Retry
rather than silently rendering nothing, and a monotonic fetch-sequence guard
discards a stale response that resolves after a newer one (e.g. a slow
fetch completing after a context switch already rendered the fresher
result).

This is additive to, not a replacement for, the wizard in this slice:
first-Program bootstrapping still belongs to Initial Setup above — an
operator with zero Programs sees nothing from this card (`get_setup_progress`
returns an empty `workflows: []` rather than inventing progress for a Program
that does not exist yet), and a fresh, genuinely-incomplete League Admin
session still lands there first. Per #204's IA crosswalk the wizard is slated
to eventually fold into this same hub's "Imports and onboarding" workflow
rather than stay a standalone screen — not done as of this slice.

"Imports and onboarding" (the sixth workflow) reports a third status,
`"optional"`, instead of `"done"`/`"todo"`: it is a standing, always-
available alternative entry point into the other five (bulk-import teams/
players, officials/availability, or rinks/ice-slots), not an independently
gated step. Unlike the other five, there is no reliable Program-scoped "has
an import ever run here" signal to compute a real done/todo state from —
two of the three import-commit paths write only aggregate counts into their
own audit summary row, no season- or program-derivable field. An earlier
shape derived "done" from whether the other five happened to all be done,
which was an invented rule with no such grounding and, as a side effect,
made this workflow impossible to ever surface as `next`. `"optional"` is
never a candidate for `next` and never blocks `complete`, but the workflow
stays fully visible on the card and independently reachable at all times via
the persistent Import nav tab both League Admin and Arena Manager hold.
Proposed as decision 9 in `docs/product/operator-ux-requirements.md`'s
"Product decisions requiring sign-off" section — implemented as the working
assumption in PR #331, but not yet confirmed by the product owner and
reversible pending that confirmation.

## Authorization and privacy invariants

- The bootstrap claim is the only unauthenticated mutation, and only on a fresh,
  durable, unclaimed installation.
- After claim, all setup and onboarding-status detail requires an authenticated
  League Admin. An Arena Manager manages facility inventory but cannot claim an
  installation, create League Admin accounts, or read client-wide onboarding
  detail — the one exception is the Home/Tasks hub's Program-scoped
  `/api/v2/setup/progress` (§7), which both roles read since both land on that
  hub.
- Passwords and the setup code never appear in responses, logs, audit detail,
  browser state, or toasts. Post-claim actor attribution comes from the session.
- Onboarding status, the setup hierarchy, and the acceptance report expose
  counts and structural names only — never player names or credentials.
