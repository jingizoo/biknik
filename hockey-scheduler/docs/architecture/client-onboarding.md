# Client production onboarding

The end-to-end journey a new client follows from a fresh production deployment
to scheduling their first game, and how each step is verified. This ties
together the pieces built under #174; deployment mechanics (env vars, backup
commands, migration checks) live in the [production runbook](production-runbook.md),
which this guide references rather than repeats.

## The journey

```text
Fresh production deployment (durable DB, no demo data)
  → client claims the installation with a one-time setup code
  → client creates their own first League Admin and signs in
  → guided Initial Setup walks the hierarchy: owner → program → venues/rinks
    → season/league/divisions → clubs/teams → players/officials → game ice → staff
  → each step is entered manually or bulk-imported from templates
  → onboarding status reports what still blocks scheduling
  → back up / restore is proven to reproduce the configured client
  → begin scheduling
```

Every write goes through the normal service → store → audit path; nothing about
setup progress lives in the browser. Restart, redeploy, or a fresh sign-in all
resume from the same server-derived state.

## 1. Durable production deployment

Production must run on a durable SQL store and never seed demo data. Set
`APP_MODE=production` and a real `DATABASE_URL` (durable Postgres, or a real
SQLite file for a single-instance pilot). `/api/readiness` fails closed for
in-memory or ephemeral storage, stale migrations, missing admin, or unhardened
cookies — treat it as the go/no-go gate before routing traffic. See the runbook
sections *Environment*, *Migration verification*, and *Durable-store readiness*.

## 2. One-time client-owned admin claim

The client creates their own first League Admin in the browser at `/setup`, so
the deployment operator never chooses, sees, or stores the client's password.
The operator generates a high-entropy `INITIAL_SETUP_CODE`, delivers it through
a secure channel, and the client exchanges it (plus a username/password of their
choosing) for exactly one atomically-created League Admin.

- `GET /api/bootstrap/status` → `claim_available` reflects a fresh, durable,
  unclaimed installation with a configured code — and nothing else (no account
  count, username, or database detail).
- `POST /api/bootstrap/claim` validates the code in constant time, creates the
  admin, marks the installation claimed, and audits the claim. A second attempt
  fails closed with `409 already_claimed`; two admins can never exist.

Remove `INITIAL_SETUP_CODE` after a successful claim. Full mechanics: runbook
*One-time client-owned admin claim*.

## 3. Guided Initial Setup

A first admin signing in to an empty database is routed to a resumable **Initial
Setup** wizard that sequences the whole hierarchy. It does not trap the admin —
they can navigate to any advanced screen — and it never stores progress in the
browser; every step reads back from persisted data. Each step reuses the
existing Setup drawers, the Users screen, the Import screen, and the Calendar.

## 4. Manual entry and bulk import converge on one model

Both paths write the same domain entities through the same services — the wizard
creates no parallel data store. Small configurations can be typed in; a full
client hierarchy is imported from nine CSV sheets on the Import screen:
`organizations`, `programs`, `venues_rinks`, `competition` (season/league/
optional division), `clubs`, `permanent_teams`, `players`, `registrations`, and
`season_venue_access` (issue #260's locked design). Imports are matched by
stable external codes (never names — a Club's `club_code` closed the last gap),
validate every cross-file reference before any write (every error in one pass,
never fail-fast), commit each batch in one transaction, are idempotent on
repeat upload, and never delete rows that are absent from a later file. A
`registrations` row's `league_code` is always explicit and validated against the
season's chain — never derived from a division or "the season's only league".
Every commit reports created/updated/skipped counts per entity and writes a
batch audit plus entity audits attributed to the signed-in admin.

The Import screen's "Setup profile" — seven quick questions (what you're
setting up, whether you use clubs/divisions, importing players now, one venue
or several, granting venue access now, first-time vs. updating) — is pure
UI-routing state: it only decides which of the nine sheet cards are shown and
which contextual hints appear, has no backend field of its own, and is never
persisted. Every answer combination still submits through this one canonical
import engine.

## 5. Onboarding status: what still blocks scheduling

`GET /api/v2/onboarding/status` (League-Admin only, canonical vocabulary —
same shape as the legacy `GET /api/onboarding/status`) derives progress from
persisted records and the owner/program/venue rules — never a browser step
counter. It returns ordered `steps`, a flat `blocking` list (each individually
actionable — missing organization, program, owner tie, venue, rink, game ice,
season, league, division, team, or a dangling parent), and non-blocking
`warnings` (no players or officials yet, orphaned records). `ready_to_schedule`
is true when nothing blocks; `complete` additionally requires the warnings
clear. The wizard's **Start scheduling** action unlocks only when
`ready_to_schedule` is true.

## 6. Recovery: backup and restore

A configured client must be reproducible from a backup. The runbook documents
the `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` (Postgres) and file-copy (SQLite) mechanics; the
checked-in acceptance smoke proves the round trip actually works:

```bash
python -m hockey_scheduler.acceptance.backup_restore --database-url ./client.db
```

It backs the deployment up, restores into a fresh empty database, starts the app
against the restore, and verifies the record census and onboarding status match
the source — exiting non-zero on any divergence. Run it after configuring a
client and after any risky operation. See runbook *Backup/restore acceptance
check*.

## Authorization and privacy invariants

- The bootstrap claim is the only unauthenticated mutation, and only on a fresh,
  durable, unclaimed installation.
- After claim, all setup and onboarding-status detail requires an authenticated
  League Admin. An Arena Manager manages facility inventory but cannot claim an
  installation, create League Admin accounts, or read client-wide onboarding
  detail.
- Passwords and the setup code never appear in responses, logs, audit detail,
  browser state, or toasts. Post-claim actor attribution comes from the session.
- Onboarding status, the setup hierarchy, and the acceptance report expose
  counts and structural names only — never player names or credentials.
